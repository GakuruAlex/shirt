# CS50 P-Shirt #

A program that expects exactly two command-line arguments:

    in sys.argv[1], the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to read (i.e., open) as input
    in sys.argv[2], the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to write (i.e., save) as output
The program should then overlay shirt.png (which has a transparent background) on the input after resizing and cropping the input to be the same size, saving the result as its output
